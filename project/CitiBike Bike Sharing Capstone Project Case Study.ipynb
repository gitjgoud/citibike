    "## CitiBike Bike Sharing Capstone Project Case Study\n",
    "- In this capstone project proposal, we investigate **CitiBike**, the shared bike system of **New York City**.\n",
    "- Bike/Scooter sharing is a new **p2p** consumer business model which uses high-tech to address the traditional **last-mile** problem in public transportation. In the metropolitan areas, the commuters are often stuck with the inability of public transportation (either subway or buses) to reach the target destination or suffer in the traffic jam, lack of parking space, and the air pollution if they choose to drive private vehicles.\n",
    "- Bike/scooter sharing makes the public transportation more attractive by offering the 'last-mile' transportation equipments (through timed rental) from the transportation hubs to/near the target destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shared bikes can be categorized into \n",
    "   - dockstation version: Popular in U.S.\n",
    "   - dockless version:  Very popular in the rest of the world, particularly in China, \n",
    "    but fail to prosper in U.S. due to tight municipal regulations. Some makes use of IoT (internet of things) technology.\n",
    "   - e-bike (bikes with supplemental battery power)\n",
    "   \n",
    "- In New York City, there are at least $12000$ **citibikes**, with more than $750$ dock stations. **CitiBike**, operated by **motivate** (a subsidiary company of **Lyft**, a sillicon valley tech company specializes in ride-sharing using AI), gains monopoly to operate shared-bikes in NYC (granted by NYC DOT) expiring in 2029. The lack of competition allows it to open up the per-ride data in exchange for faster innovation. This allows us to use its data for our case study. \n",
    "- **CitiBank** does not own or operate **CitiBike**. Instead it is merely the **name sponsor**, i.e. boughting the naming rights for advertising and positive PR.\n",
    "- In New York area, **CitiBike** operates in the $5$ boroughs as well as Jersey city.\n",
    "- The anymonous trip system data can be found at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.\n",
    "- **Citibike** was lauched in Sep $2013$, Up to now it has aggregatively about $90M$ rides throughout the years.\n",

    "### ML Question 6: Clustering the Usage Patterns of Dock Stations\n",
    "- Excluding the outlier situations that the dock stations are shut down temporally, each dock station has its intraday\n",
    "ride count (say by hour or 15 minutes intervals) profile. These profiles evolve as the customer base grows or \n",
    "new dock stations are built.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending on whether hourly intervals or quarterly intervals are used, each dock station usage profile can be viewed as a\n",
    "vector in ${\\bf R}^{24}$ or ${\\bf R}^{96}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using euclidean distance or cosine distance (if the profiles are demeaned), use a suitable clustering algorithm to study\n",
    "the similarities of different dock stations.  It would be ideal to be able to interpret your result properly, say why certain\n",
    "dock stations are more similar to each other. It would be also interesting to observe how does the dock-station grouping\n",
    "change w.r.t. the time evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The systemwise intraday ride count pattern, divided by the total same-day ride count, can be treated as a vector in ${\\bf R}^{24}$ or\n",
    " ${\\bf R}^{96}$, depending on whether we choose the hourly or quarter-of-a-hour time intervals.\n",
    "Each entry represents the fraction of rides in that given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $6+$ years of data generates $2000+$ sample points. The action of dividing the raw ride counts/unit interval by the daily ride count decouples the profiles\n",
    "from the fluctuations of daily ride counts. So our focus is purely on the ride distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use kMeans and Gaussian mixture models (a soft clustering technique) to analyze the problem. What cluster number $K$\n",
    " would you choose?  Are you able to interpret your result?\n",
